# alpha-codegen

There are currently two versions of AlphaZ:
* old version (alphaz)
* new version (alpha-language)
This repository is a temporary solution for generating demand driven code in the new version.
Currently, the new version has a demand driven code generator but it only generates the system file, not the makefile and the wrapper.

For a given input alpha program, this project can be used to produce:
* the new demand driven code for the primary alpha system
* the old wrapper
* the old makefile
